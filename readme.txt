This is a project after I learned Javascript at Udemy
///User story//////
1. As a user, I want to search for recipes, so that I can find new ideas for meals.
2. As a user, I want to be able to update the number of servings, so that I can cook a meal for a different number of people.
3. As a user, I want to bookmark recipes to review them later.
4. As a user, I want to be able to create my own recipes, so that I have them all organized in the same app.
5. As a user, I want to be able to see my bookmarks and own recipes when I leave the app and come back
later so that I can close the app safely after cooking.
